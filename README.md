# Tic-Tac-Toe
This is a classic Tic-Tac-Toe game developed using basic web technologies. It is a two-player game where users take turns to place "X" and "O" in a 3x3 grid. The game automatically checks for win conditions and highlights the winner. If all cells are filled without a winner, the game ends in a draw.
